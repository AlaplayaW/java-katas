## Shape

Create three classes which implements the interface `Shape` :
* `Rectangle`
* `Triangle`
* `Circle`

For each classes, add the necessary attributes (must be `double`), then a constructor to initialise these and finally implement the `area` method.

Create a class `Square`, which inherits `Rectangle`.
Add a `side` attribute (must be `double`), then add a constructor that calls `super`.

### Bonus :

* Create a list of Shape objects and order them by ascending area (using Comparator)
